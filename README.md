# gifbot

Gifbot is a Slack bot that gives you better gifs.

We've all been there; having the perfect moment to react with a gif, and then having giphy fall flat on its face, due to some poorly user-defined content.

Gifbot changes that. Mention `@gifbot` with your desired gif, and gifbot will DM you options for gifs until it gives you the perfect one.

## How to use

- Mention `@gifbot` with your gif request
- gifbot will DM you a gif, asking if this one is good
- respond "yes" or "no" until you find one you like
- gifbot posts your perfect gif to the channel

## How to install
